## 📝 Abstract

Customer churn is a critical issue impacting business revenue and retention. This project explores churn prediction using machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** in **RStudio**. The project uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle, supplemented by a small primary dataset. Visual analytics and performance evaluations help translate complex technical findings into easily understandable insights for business users.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **RStudio**: Data manipulation, modeling, and basic visualization
- **Python**: Advanced visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- **Libraries Used**: `randomForest`, `glm`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `seaborn`, `plotly`

---

## 🔍 Key Techniques & Methodologies

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding factors
- **Model Building**: Random Forest & Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
- **Visualization**:
  - Churn Distribution & Trends
  - Monthly Charges vs Total Charges
  - Contract Type vs Churn
  - Violin, Radar, Heatmaps & Sankey Charts

---

## 📈 Results

| Model              | Accuracy |
|-------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 78.79%   |
| Random Forest       | 79.64%   |

- **Key Churn Indicators**: Tenure, TotalCharges, MonthlyCharges
- **High Churn Segments**: Month-to-month contracts, low tenure, electronic payment users

---

## 🎯 Business Insights

- Customers with short tenures and high monthly charges are more likely to churn.
- Long-term contracts reduce churn significantly.
- Visualizations assist non-technical stakeholders in understanding key churn patterns.
